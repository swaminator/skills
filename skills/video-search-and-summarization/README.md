# VSS Skills

Skills for working with the **NVIDIA Blueprint for Video Search & Summarization (VSS)** — a suite of GPU-accelerated microservices for building vision agents and video-analytics applications. Skills are grouped by what they do — `deployment/` stands a stack up, `operations/` drives a running one, `tools/` and `benchmarking/` hold standalone utilities, and `vss-build-vision-ai` sits at the top level as the entry point that composes the rest. Each skill directory is self-contained and follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) specification, with `name`, `description`, `version`, and `license` declared in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter. A skill's name is its directory's leaf name; the category is repository organisation and does not appear in the installed path. **`metadata.version` is not edited by hand:** it is the repository's one version — the nearest `v*` git tag rendered as SemVer (`3.3.0-rc0` on the 3.3.0 line before its release), the same source `hatch-vcs` versions the agent (`GET /api/v1/version`) and the CLI (`vss --version`) from. [`stamp_versions.py`](../.github/scripts/stamp_versions.py) writes it into every skill (and the deployment edges' version fields) from the tag; a maintainer runs it after a new `v*` tag and lands the result in a normal PR, and CI's `--check` fails any PR whose fields disagree with each other or fall behind the tag. For a **release**, stamp first (`stamp_versions.py --version X.Y.Z`), land that commit, then tag it — tags are immutable, so this order is what makes the tagged tree agree with the tag. See [`version-convention.md`](../.github/version-convention.md).

The `benchmarking/` skills additionally declare **`requires-vss`** under `metadata:` — the range of VSS deployment versions the skill supports, as comma-separated `>=`/`>`/`<`/`<=`/`==` comparators over bare `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g. `requires-vss: ">=3.2.0,<4.0.0"`). It is checked against `GET /api/v1/version` on the deployment by [`services/agent/scripts/check_vss_version.py`](../services/agent/scripts/check_vss_version.py), which `vss-benchmark-video-summarization`'s `preflight.sh` runs before every benchmark. Prerelease and build metadata are ignored when satisfying a range, so a prerelease of X.Y.Z counts as X.Y.Z and the Helm default (`3.3.0-65576357eb80`) behaves exactly like the Compose default (`3.3.0`). **Each skill's `author` owns its `requires-vss`:** shipping a new VSS minor does not widen any range, and the check failing closed is the signal to review and bump it. Full contract, including the checker's exit codes, is in [`services/agent/README.md`](../services/agent/README.md#deployment-version-api).

> **New here? Read [Orientation](#orientation-how-vss-fits-together) first, then [Which skill do I need?](#which-skill-do-i-need).** Those two sections are the fastest path from a user request to the right skill.

These skills are a **developer-side tool**: a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, NemoClaw, or any agentskills.io host) loads them to *deploy and operate* a VSS deployment from natural language. They are distinct from the in-product **VSS Agent**, which runs *inside* a deployed VSS workflow and orchestrates microservices to answer end-user questions. The skills here drive VSS; the VSS Agent is one of the things they can drive.

## Orientation: how VSS fits together

VSS-based deployments are multi-layer systems. Most skills map to exactly one layer, so knowing the layers tells you which skill to reach for. Video flows top-to-bottom: raw frames are turned into features in real time, those features are published to a message bus, analyzed downstream, placed in storage or accessed by an agent to generate results (i.e. summaries, search, etc).

  MIDDLEWARE (cross-cutting): Video IO & Storage (VIOS) · API Gateway / MCP ·
  Message Broker (Kafka/Redis) · Database (Elasticsearch) · Calibration
```

**Two ways skills are used** — most workflows touch both:

- **Deploy time** — *"Deploy VSS for video search."* A skill selects the right profile or microservice, runs pre-flight checks, and brings up the Docker Compose stack. (`vss-deploy-*`, `vss-setup-*`, `vss-generate-video-calibration`)
- **Runtime** — *"Add this camera," "summarize this clip," "show me today's incidents."* Once VSS is running, a skill calls the live REST / MCP / VIOS APIs. (everything else)

**Kubernetes runtime endpoint contract.** Operate skills run on the caller's
host, not inside VSS pods. Supply one public Ingress origin as
`VSS_PUBLIC_URL` (Helm `global.externalHost` / main Ingress host — e.g.
`vss.<ip>.nip.io` for **base**, **lvs**, and **alerts**, `vss-search.<ip>.nip.io`
for **search**). Canonical variable mapping, Docker fallbacks, and the
no-port-forward rule live in
[`vss-build-vision-ai/references/deployment_resolution.md`](vss-build-vision-ai/references/deployment_resolution.md).
Every service is mounted at its own name on that origin, the same on every
profile and on the Docker edge — the table in
[`deploy/helm/services/common/README.md`](../deploy/helm/services/common/README.md).
Base quickstart operate uses `/vst` (VIOS) and `/rtvi-vlm/v1` (RT-VLM) for
`vss-manage-video-io-storage`, `vss-ask-video`, and `vss-generate-video-report`
Mode A. LVS operate uses `/lvs/v1/ready` and `/lvs/v1/summarize` for
`vss-summarize-video` (and report Mode A when LVS is ready), with RT-VLM at the
same `/rtvi-vlm/v1` as everywhere else. Nothing is published at the origin root
`/v1`. Alerts operate
uses `/vst`, `/alert-bridge` for `vss-manage-alerts` (rules + incidents; never
Agent `/generate` for rule CRUD), and `/video-analytics-api` through
`vss analytics` for `vss-query-analytics` — not Elasticsearch `:9200`,
VA-MCP `:9901`, or RT-VLM `:8018` through Ingress. Search archive
operate uses `/generate` and `/api/v1` via `vss-search-archive`. NvStreamer
requires a separate `VSS_STREAMER_URL`. When `VSS_PUBLIC_URL` is unset, each
skill retains its documented Docker Compose discovery or `HOST_IP` fallback.

**Profiles vs. standalone microservices.** A *profile* is a pre-assembled stack of microservices wired together for one workflow. Use **`vss-build-vision-ai`** to bring up a whole workflow (`base`, `search`, `lvs`, `alerts`, `warehouse`, `edge`). Use the individual **`vss-deploy-*` / `vss-setup-*`** skills only when you need one microservice on its own.

| Profile | Workflow it deploys |
|---|---|
| `base` | Video retrieval, VLM Q&A, and report generation on short clips (the quickstart) |
| `search` | Natural-language search across video archives using embeddings |
| `lvs` | Summarization of long recordings via chunking + dense-caption aggregation |
| `alerts` | Real-time perception → behavior analytics → VLM alert verification |
| `warehouse` / `edge` | Industry example stacks and edge-device deployments |

| Diagnose idle GPU gaps or underfilled vLLM/RT-VLM execution | [`profile-vllm-performance`](benchmarking/profile-vllm-performance/SKILL.md) |

**Skills chain.** Skills auto-invoke each other when a prerequisite is missing — e.g. `vss-deploy-detection-tracking-3d` calls `vss-generate-video-calibration` when calibration data is absent. When a request spans layers (deploy a profile *and* add a camera *and* run a search), the agent composes several skills in sequence — or `vss-build-vision-ai` composes the deploy half for you. The catalog below is grouped by directory, with each skill's pipeline layer in its own column.

**Easy to confuse:**

- `vss-ask-video` (one-off VLM question on a clip) vs. `vss-search-archive` (retrieval across an archive) vs. `vss-query-analytics` (read already-computed metrics/incidents — no live inference).
- `vss-generate-video-report` (formatted report from per-clip VLM or an incident range) vs. `vss-generate-video-report-rag` (the frag/RAG pipeline with HITL parameter collection).
- `vss-build-vision-ai` (a whole workflow stack) vs. the `vss-deploy-*` / `vss-setup-*` skills (a single microservice).

---

## Catalog

Grouped the way the directory is: `vss-build-vision-ai` at the top, then
`deployment/`, `operations/`, `tools/`, `benchmarking/`. The **Layer** column
carries the pipeline position from [Orientation](#orientation-how-vss-fits-together)
so the conceptual map survives the regrouping — a skill's directory says *when*
you reach for it, its layer says *where it sits in the video path*.

A skill's invocable name is its directory's leaf name. The category is
repository organisation only and never appears in the installed path or in the
`/slash-command`.

### Start here

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| [vss-build-vision-ai](vss-build-vision-ai/SKILL.md) | Compose, configure, deploy, verify, or tear down a whole VSS workflow — the `base`, `search`, `lvs` and `alerts` developer profiles, the `warehouse` industry profile, or a custom delta overlay on one of them. **Start here for a full workflow.** Hands off to the `operations/` skills once the stack is up, and to a single `deployment/` skill when only one microservice is wanted. |

### `deployment/` — stand one service up on its own

| Skill | Layer | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [vss-deploy-warehouse-helm](deployment/vss-deploy-warehouse-helm/SKILL.md) | whole stack | Deploy/upgrade the warehouse blueprint (2D/3D/MV3DT) on Kubernetes via Helm, with GPU-aware `NUM_STREAMS` capping so the request never exceeds what the perception pipeline can sustain. |
| [vss-deploy-detection-tracking-2d](deployment/vss-deploy-detection-tracking-2d/SKILL.md) | 1 | Deploy/operate the RTVI-CV perception microservice for 2D detection & tracking (`warehouse-2d/3d`, `smartcity-rtdetr/gdino`) and call its REST API. |
| [vss-deploy-detection-tracking-3d](deployment/vss-deploy-detection-tracking-3d/SKILL.md) | 1 | Deploy/operate the standalone RTVI-CV-3D stack (MV3DT / Multi-View 3D Tracking) for calibrated MP4/file inputs or live RTSP streams, with BEV Fusion and saved/live outputs. Auto-chains to calibration when missing; explicit warehouse profile MV3DT requests route to `vss-build-vision-ai`. |
| [vss-deploy-dense-captioning](deployment/vss-deploy-dense-captioning/SKILL.md) | 1 | Deploy and call the RT-VLM dense-captioning microservice (captions, alerts, stream management, OpenAI-compatible completions) on files and live RTSP. |
| [rtvi-byom-porting](deployment/rtvi-byom-porting/SKILL.md) | 1 | Port, integrate, and validate custom VLMs in RT-VLM while preserving the existing serving contract. |
| [vss-deploy-video-embedding](deployment/vss-deploy-video-embedding/SKILL.md) | 1 | Deploy and operate the RT-Embed video-embedding microservice — `/v1` REST API for file/text/video embeddings and live RTSP, plus Redis/Kafka/OTel integration. |
| [vss-setup-behavior-analytics](deployment/vss-setup-behavior-analytics/SKILL.md) | 2 | Deploy the `vss-behavior-analytics` service standalone — pick the entrypoint (Analytics 2D / 3D / mv3dt, search_and_alerts), point it at a profile-shipped or custom config and optional calibration, and (with a Kafka / Redis Streams / MQTT broker reachable) push dynamic-config and dynamic-calibration updates over the `mdx-notification` topic — all without bringing up the full warehouse stack. |
| [vss-setup-video-analytics-api](deployment/vss-setup-video-analytics-api/SKILL.md) | 2 | Deploy the `vss-video-analytics-api` REST service standalone against custom Elasticsearch and Kafka infrastructure. |

### `operations/` — drive a stack that is already running

| Skill | Layer | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [vss-search-archive](operations/vss-search-archive/SKILL.md) | 3 | Search video archives with natural language using multi-embedding fusion (Cosmos-Embed1) plus CV attribute matching; hands file/RTSP source registration to `vss-manage-video-io-storage`. |
| [vss-summarize-video](operations/vss-summarize-video/SKILL.md) | 3 | Summarize a recorded video via chunking, dense captioning, and aggregation using the Long Video Summarization (LVS) microservice (HITL-gated, VLM fallback). |
| [vss-ask-video](operations/vss-ask-video/SKILL.md) | 3 | Route video questions through hot conversation context, agent Markdown memory, structured VSS memory, bounded memory introspection, or a direct `vss vlm run` for an explicitly scoped fresh inspection. |
| [vss-generate-video-report](operations/vss-generate-video-report/SKILL.md) | 3 | Produce a formatted markdown report through one of three backends — per-clip VLM, delegating to `vss-summarize-video` when LVS is ready or the clip is 120 seconds or longer (Mode A), incident-range via `vss-query-analytics` (Mode B), or SOP compliance via the SOP tools (Mode C). Never via the VSS agent's `/generate`. |
| [vss-generate-video-report-rag](operations/vss-generate-video-report-rag/SKILL.md) | 3 | Generate video summary reports with Enterprise RAG context using the VSS frag/RAG pipeline and HITL parameter collection. |
| [vss-query-analytics](operations/vss-query-analytics/SKILL.md) | 3 | Query analytics metrics, incidents, alerts, and analytics sensor data through the project-local `vss analytics` CLI and configured Video Analytics API. |
| [vss-manage-alerts](operations/vss-manage-alerts/SKILL.md) | 2 | Add, manage, and monitor alerts on streamed video — CV verification mode or VLM real-time mode, Alert-Bridge subscriptions, Slack notifications, camera onboarding. |
| [vss-manage-video-io-storage](operations/vss-manage-video-io-storage/SKILL.md) | middleware | Video/stream management, recording timelines, clip extraction, snapshots, and add/delete sensors via the Video IO & Storage (VIOS) microservices. |

### `tools/` — standalone utilities

| Skill | Layer | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [vss-generate-video-calibration](tools/vss-generate-video-calibration/SKILL.md) | middleware | Run AutoMagicCalib (AMC) camera calibration on local MP4s, RTSP streams, or the bundled sample dataset; deploy the `vss-auto-calibration` microservice when needed. Usually reached automatically as a prerequisite of 3D tracking. |

### `benchmarking/` — measure a deployment

| Skill | Layer | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [vss-benchmark-vlm-qa](benchmarking/vss-benchmark-vlm-qa/SKILL.md) | — | E2E video Q&A accuracy + latency on `vss-devx-base` through `vss vlm run` (CR3 RT-VLM). Replaces `nat eval` QA. Not tool-calling / trajectory. |
| [vss-benchmark-video-summarization](benchmarking/vss-benchmark-video-summarization/SKILL.md) | — | LVS latency and burst-throughput on a deployed summarization instance. |
| [profile-vllm-performance](benchmarking/profile-vllm-performance/SKILL.md) | 1 | Attribute GPU-idle gaps, underfilled batches, serialized multimodal work, transfer stalls, scheduler gaps, and KV pressure with correlated profiler evidence before changing vLLM or RT-VLM. |
| [rtvi-vlm-perf-testing](benchmarking/rtvi-vlm-perf-testing/SKILL.md) | 1 | Plan and execute fresh-container RT-VLM GPU canaries with semantic stream-isolation and reproducible evidence. |
| [vss-evaluate-caption-accuracy](benchmarking/vss-evaluate-caption-accuracy/SKILL.md) | — | Check whether an RT-VLM configuration change moved caption quality: capture paired baseline and candidate captions, score both against a ground truth with an LLM judge, and emit an accuracy and processing-time table. |

Skills with `evals/*.json` specs are exercised automatically by the Skills Eval CI workflow on every PR that touches `skills/**`; legacy `eval/*.json` specs are still accepted for skills that have not moved yet. See [`.github/skill-eval/AGENTS.md`](../.github/skill-eval/AGENTS.md) for harness behavior.

## Renamed in GA

The VSS 3.2 GA skill names replaced the pre-GA slash-command names:

| Pre-GA command | VSS 3.2 GA command |
|---|---|
| `/alerts` | `/vss-manage-alerts` |
| `/deploy` | `/vss-build-vision-ai` |
| `/report` | `/vss-generate-video-report` |
| `/rt-vlm` | `/vss-deploy-dense-captioning` |
| `/video-analytics` | `/vss-query-analytics` |
| `/video-search` | `/vss-search-archive` |
| `/video-summarization` | `/vss-summarize-video` |
| `/video-understanding` | `/vss-ask-video` |
| `/vios` | `/vss-manage-video-io-storage` |
| `/vss-frag` | `/vss-generate-video-report-rag` |

## Install

Skills install **flat, by leaf name** — the category is repository organisation and
never appears in the installed path or in the `/slash-command`:

| Host | Skills directory |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` |
| Codex | `~/.codex/skills/<name>/` |
| Hosts following the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) universal path | `~/.agents/skills/<name>/` |

Symlink rather than copy, so a `git pull` here keeps every install current.

### Recommended — the entry point plus the operations skills

`vss-build-vision-ai` is the way in: it takes an intent ("build a vision agent",
"add agentic search to my base deployment") and composes, configures and deploys
a stack. But it deliberately stops at the deploy boundary — its `SKILL.md` routes
*"search, summarize, VIOS, alerts, reports, and video Q&A"* to the matching
`operations/` skill, and a single-microservice request to the matching
`deployment/` skill. Install it alone and the agent can build you a stack it then
cannot drive.

So install the entry point **and** `operations/`. Open this repository in your
coding agent and paste:

> Install these VSS skills for this host: `skills/vss-build-vision-ai/` and every
> skill under `skills/operations/`. Use the host's standard skills directory
> (Claude Code `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`, Codex `~/.codex/skills/<name>/`,
> otherwise `~/.agents/skills/<name>/`), naming each install after the skill's own
> directory name — not its category. Symlink rather than copy so a `git pull` keeps
> them current, and skip any already pointing at this checkout. List what you
> registered and where.

That covers the full journey: build and deploy a stack, then search it, summarize
it, ask questions of it, manage its alerts, and read its analytics.

### Add the rest when you need it

| Also install | When |
|---|---|
| `skills/deployment/` | You want one microservice on its own — RT-VLM, RT-CV, RT-Embed, behavior analytics, the analytics API — or Helm/Kubernetes rather than Compose. |
| `skills/tools/` | You are calibrating multi-camera datasets directly. (3D tracking pulls this in automatically when calibration is missing, so you only need it standalone.) |
| `skills/benchmarking/` | You are measuring VLM Q&A accuracy/latency, profiling vLLM or RT-VLM execution, measuring LVS throughput, or checking caption-accuracy regressions. |

> Also install every skill under `skills/deployment/` the same way.

### Everything

> Read `skills/README.md` and every `SKILL.md` file under `skills/`. For each skill
> in the catalog, install it for this host so I can invoke it from a shell or chat
> session, using the host's standard skills directory and naming each install after
> the skill's own directory name rather than its category. Symlink each skill folder
> rather than copying it. Skip skills already installed and pointing at this
> checkout. When you're done, list the skills you registered and which directory you
> used.

### Single-skill install

Most skills sit inside a category; `vss-build-vision-ai` is at the top of `skills/`.
Give the agent the path as it appears in the catalog above:

> Install only `skills/<path-from-the-catalog>/` for this host the same way — for
> example `skills/operations/vss-search-archive/` or `skills/vss-build-vision-ai/`.
> Register it under the skill's own directory name, without any category prefix.

### Update

After `git pull` the symlinks already resolve to the updated content, so a content
change needs nothing. Two cases do need action, because an install is a symlink to a
repository path rather than to a name:

- a **new** skill has no symlink yet
- a skill that **moved between categories** (or was renamed) leaves its old symlink
  dangling — the leaf name still appears installed, but its target no longer exists

Both are covered by:

> Re-check this host's skills directory against `skills/README.md`. Add a symlink for
> any catalog skill that is missing. Then check every VSS skill symlink already there:
> if its target no longer exists, or points somewhere other than that skill's current
> path in this checkout, repoint it. Remove symlinks for skills that are no longer in
> the catalog. Report what you added, repointed, and removed.

### Uninstall

> Remove every VSS skill symlink you previously created under this host's skills
> directory.

## Source of truth

This `skills/` directory is the canonical source. Skills published to the public catalog at `github.com/nvidia/skills` are mirrored from here at sync time.

**Deprecated skills are still mirrored.** A skill marked deprecated continues to sync to the public catalog for one release carrying its deprecation notice, so anyone who already installed it sees the redirect before it disappears. It is dropped from the catalog in the release that deletes it from this directory.
