# Brev Environment Reference

How to deploy VSS on a Brev GPU instance so the UI and API are reachable
from a browser via Brev **secure links** (a Cloudflare-fronted reverse proxy).

This reference derives from `deploy/docker/scripts/deploy_vss_launchable.ipynb`, which is the
interactive reference implementation.

## When this applies

A Brev-managed instance publishes an **environment context file** —
`$BREV_ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT_PATH`, conventionally
`/etc/brev/environment-context.json` — listing one entry per exposed port with
its `destination_port`, `public_port`, and `fqdn`. It also sets
`BREV_ENV_ID=<instance-id>` in `/etc/environment`. If neither is present you are
not on a Brev-provisioned instance and this reference doesn't apply — use the
normal host IP + port access pattern from the selected file under `profiles/`.

**Resolve every hostname from the context file; never build one from a
pattern.** The domain is not always `brevlab.com` and the prefix convention
varies. Read the `fqdn` for the port you want. A port with no entry is not
exposed and has no URL. Resolve it with the helpers under
[Resolving a secure link](#resolving-a-secure-link).

## Architecture

## Resolving a secure link

Look the port up in the context file. These helpers are used throughout this
reference; define them once per shell:

```bash
BREV_CTX="${BREV_ENVIRONMENT_CONTEXT_PATH:-/etc/brev/environment-context.json}"
# FQDN published for a destination port; empty when the port is not exposed.
brev_fqdn() { jq -er --argjson p "$1" '[.ports[]? | select(.destination_port == $p) | .fqdn][0] // empty' "$BREV_CTX" 2>/dev/null; }
# Public port for that link (443 in current Brev; read it, don't assume it).
brev_public_port() { jq -er --argjson p "$1" '[.ports[]? | select(.destination_port == $p) | .public_port][0] // empty' "$BREV_CTX" 2>/dev/null; }
# Browse origin for that port. Use this for any URL you hand the user or curl:
# an origin built from the FQDN alone is wrong wherever public_port is not 443.
brev_origin() {
  local host port
  host="$(brev_fqdn "$1")" && port="$(brev_public_port "$1")" || return 1
  if [ "$port" = 443 ]; then echo "https://${host}"; else echo "https://${host}:${port}"; fi
}

brev_fqdn 7777        # hostname only — for EXTERNAL_IP / VSS_PUBLIC_HOST
brev_public_port 7777
brev_origin 7777      # the haproxy ingress link — the VSS browse origin
```

`7777` is the destination port on the instance — the HAProxy ingress VSS exposes.
An empty result means no link is published for it: expose one in Brev, or deploy
behind a port that has one. Do not fall back to constructing a hostname.

### When the helpers return nothing
<a id="confined-read"></a>

`/etc/brev` is `0700 root:root`. An agent process holding no capabilities is
denied it even as uid 0 ([`prerequisites.md`](prerequisites.md#confinement)).
`read_brev_environment_context` retries that denial as `sudo -n cat` before
turning it into `{}` — which recovers the file for a host shell holding
passwordless sudo, and not for an agent whose `sudo` is refused by policy. When
the retry fails too, the helpers above return nothing instead of failing,
logging `context ... is unreadable` at `WARNING` and carrying on. **An empty
result is not "no link is published".** Distinguish the two before reporting
either; the warning line tells you which one you have.

`dockerd` holds the capabilities the agent lacks, so a read-only bind mount
resolves the entry. It is a privileged read of host config: **ask the user to
approve it**, never take it unilaterally, and request the one port's entry rather
than the whole file.

```bash
docker run --rm -v /etc/brev:/brev:ro ubuntu:22.04 cat /brev/environment-context.json \
  | jq -r '.ports[]|select(.destination_port==7777)|"public_port=\(.public_port) fqdn=\(.fqdn)"'
```

Any image already on the host serves — nothing but `cat` is used — and a small
one is worth pulling on a host with none. When the approval is declined, ask the
user for the origin they browse this instance on. Never construct one either
way: the domain is `gobrev.dev` on some instances and `brevlab.com` on others,
and a wrong host `404`s every browser request while `curl localhost:7777` still
succeeds.

## Per-profile secure link requirements

| Profile | Required links | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| `base` | **7777** (HAProxy ingress — UI + Agent + VST) | 6006 (Phoenix tracing) |
| `lvs` | **7777**, **5601** (Kibana) | 6006 |
| `search` | **7777**, **5601**, **31000** (nvstreamer) | 6006 |
| `alerts` | **7777**, **5601**, **31000** (nvstreamer) | 6006 |

On a NemoClaw build, add the harness dashboard **relay** port
(`NEMOCLAW_DASHBOARD_RELAY_PORT`, default **18790**) to whichever row applies:
it is the Agent UI's own origin and is not behind HAProxy, so it needs its own
link. Resolve it the same way as 7777 — the answer decides whether the summary
reports a secure-link URL or a loopback one behind an SSH tunnel.

Publish it **before** the notebook's section 3.1. That is the step that reads the
link and exports `CHAT_UI_URL`, which onboard bakes into the image's
`gateway.controlUi` to turn device auth off for the remote UI (any origin is
allowed). A sandbox built without it cannot sign in over the link and needs
recreating once the link exists, since `gateway.*` cannot be edited afterwards.

`NEMOCLAW_DASHBOARD_PORT` (default 18789) gets no link of its own. NemoClaw
keeps that forward on loopback and the relay in front of it is the published
path.

Ports that should NOT get their own secure link (they're behind HAProxy):
3000 (UI), 8000 (Agent), 30888 (VST).

## Setup flow

Before resolving Compose, set the Brev secure-link values in the build's
`_builds/<name>/override.env`. **`EXTERNAL_IP` alone is not enough** — the Brev secure
link is served over **HTTPS on the link's own `public_port`** (443 in current
Brev — read it, per above), but the profile `.env` ships
`VSS_PUBLIC_HTTP_PROTOCOL=http`, `VSS_PUBLIC_WS_PROTOCOL=ws`, and
`VSS_PUBLIC_PORT=${HAPROXY_HOST_PORT}` (7777). Leaving those at the defaults makes the
agent emit `http://…:7777` UI/API/WS URLs from an `https://` page → the browser
blocks them as mixed content. Set the host, protocol, and port together:

```bash
BUILD_OVERRIDE="_builds/<name>/override.env"
host="$(brev_fqdn 7777)"                      # helpers from "Resolving a secure link"
port="$(brev_public_port 7777)"
[ -n "$host" ] && [ -n "$port" ] || { echo "No Brev link published for port 7777" >&2; exit 1; }
sed -i \
  -e "s|^EXTERNAL_IP=.*|EXTERNAL_IP=${host}|" \
  -e "s|^VSS_PUBLIC_HOST=.*|VSS_PUBLIC_HOST=${host}|" \
  -e "s|^VSS_PUBLIC_HTTP_PROTOCOL=.*|VSS_PUBLIC_HTTP_PROTOCOL=https|" \
  -e "s|^VSS_PUBLIC_WS_PROTOCOL=.*|VSS_PUBLIC_WS_PROTOCOL=wss|" \
  -e "s|^VSS_PUBLIC_PORT=.*|VSS_PUBLIC_PORT=${port}|" \
  "$BUILD_OVERRIDE"
```

Stop on an empty `host`; never substitute a constructed one. These values also
fill HAProxy's `known_host` allowlist, so a wrong hostname `404`s every browser
request while `curl localhost:7777` still succeeds.

On a NemoClaw build other than `alerts`, drop the `EXTERNAL_IP` line above and
leave that variable to the sandbox ([`agent-harness.md`](agent-harness.md)). The
rest is unchanged: `VSS_PUBLIC_HOST` already carries the secure link, and the
`known_host` ACL admits it in its own right.

## Verifying the deploy is reachable externally

After `docker compose up -d`:

```bash
# 1. Proxy is up and routing. Probe /, not /health: the ingress is HAProxy and its
# route table has no /health, so that path 404s on a perfectly healthy proxy.
curl -sf -o /dev/null http://localhost:7777/ && echo "proxy OK"

# 2. UI reachable through the proxy (internally)
curl -sfI http://localhost:7777/ | head -1

# 3. Print the browser URL the user should open — resolved, never constructed
brev_origin 7777
```

If step 1 fails, the haproxy container (`vss-haproxy-ingress`) hasn't come up — check
`docker logs vss-haproxy-ingress`. Common reason: another service on the host is
already bound to port 7777, or `EXTERNAL_IP` in the build override doesn't
match the secure-link domain (haproxy's `known_host` ACL rejects the
request as 404 from the browser even though `curl localhost:7777` works).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| User says the Brev link won't load at all | Compare their URL with `brev_origin 7777`. A hostname absent from the context file is not exposed. If the deployment sits behind a different exposed port, resolve that port and redeploy. |
| UI loads but AJAX calls to `/api/*` CORS-fail | A second secure link was created for port 8000 → browser treats it as a different origin. Delete the extra link; the UI should use the proxy only. |
| `curl "$(brev_origin 7777)"` → 502 | HAProxy container (`vss-haproxy-ingress`) is down — `docker logs vss-haproxy-ingress` |
| `curl "$(brev_origin 7777)"` → Cloudflare Access login page forever | User hasn't been granted access in the Brev org; not a deploy issue |
| Agent-generated report URLs don't open | `EXTERNAL_IP` in the build override is still the internal `${HOST_IP}` default → reports hard-code internal IPs. Set it from `brev_fqdn 7777` in `_builds/<name>/override.env` (see [Setup flow](#setup-flow)), regenerate `resolved.yml`, and redeploy. |
